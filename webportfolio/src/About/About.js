        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am currently located in Gainesville, Florida, as a third-year student at the University of Florida. My major is Computer Science, and I am minoring in Business Administration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over Summer 2024, I worked as an Automation Developer Intern for Crowley Maritime Corporation, where I utilized Robotic Process Automation to automate tasks such as transforming PDF data into CSV format and placing it into a Snowflake database. 
            I am currently working on the Web Development Team for Florida Community Innovation, a nonprofit organization focused on providing public service projects that range from resource access, recycling issues, and much more! Besides this, I am also part of the UF Software Engineering Club, where I am currently on the Web Development Team for the Clubfinity application, which simplifies the process of finding and attending student organization events. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In Summer 2025, I will also be a Technology Intern for CSX, where I will be working in the Cloud Services Team. There, I will be involved with Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure. I am very excited for this opportunity as I constantly look to expand my knowledge in technology, and look to grasp new skills related to cloud services for the future!
